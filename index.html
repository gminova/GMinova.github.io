            <h1>Welcome,</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Gergana (a.k.a Gigi) and I am in my 20s. I like solving problems and challenges.               
                I am native in Bulgarian, fluent in English, and I speak basic Japanese.

            <h1>Why Founders and Coders?</h1>
            <p>
                I am hoping that Founders and Coders will allow me to take my desire to help people to the next level. 
                While I first did coding as a teen in secondary school, I did not pursue my interest into university. 
                Instead, I became a nurse and I have spent the past 1.5 years working with patients and their loved ones.
                I genuinely love helping people and I am interested in humanitarian and human-centric ways to utilise 
                technologies that can bring more meaning and joy to people’s lives. As a nurse, I have seen first-hand how 
                technology affects people, and I would love to be a part of the digital transformation our society is going
                 through.</p>
                 <br>
                <p>Thus, in 2018, my passion for coding was rekindled and I undertook online courses in C#. I soon realised that
                 I wanted to change my career from nursing to a web developer, hence I began studying HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
                I found that studying on my own was quite isolating and my progress was not as rapid as I wanted it to be. This 
                is when I learned about Founders and Coders. I joined their meetup and found a very welcoming and supportive 
                community which quickly made me want to become a part of it. I truly hope I am given the opportunity to join 
                Founders and Coders this summer and fulfil my dream of becoming a full-stack web developer.</p>
