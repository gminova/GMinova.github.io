<p>Hello, I'm Gergana and I'm a nurse. I started programming when I was 15. At school, I learned the basics of Computer Science, solved challenges using C++, and learned some Visual Basic.</p>

<p>Having volunteered for the Red Cross for 3 years, I naturally pursued a degree in Nursing. After achieving my dream of becoming a nurse, my passion for solving problems and writing algorithms rekindled in 2018 when I began teaching myself C# while working full-time. I started using Linux, GitHub and more recently vim. I aspire to become a full-stack developer and  meet the demands of our ever growing digital society. </p>
<p>Have a peek at my: GitHub 
<a href="https://github.com/gminova">profile</a>, freeCodeCamp <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/gminova">profile</a>, and my Codewars <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/gminova">profile</a>.</p>
<p>This simple webpage was created without using any JavaScript or CSS libraries, neither does it use bootstrap or jQuery, as it aims to show just my code learned from scratch. No cheating! :) Peek behind the scenes and into my code <a href="https://github.com/gminova/gminova.github.io">here</a>.</p>
