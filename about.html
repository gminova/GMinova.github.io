        <h1 style="text-align:center">Why Founders and Coders?</h1>
        <div class="main-content">
            <p>I am hoping that Founders and Coders will allow me to take my desire to help people to the next level. 
            <p>While I first did coding as a teen in secondary school, I did not pursue my interest into university. Instead, I became a nurse and I have spent the past 1.5 years working with patients and their loved ones.</p>
            <p>I genuinely love helping people and I am interested in humanitarian and human-centric ways to utilise technologies that can bring more meaning and joy to people’s lives. As a nurse, I have seen first-hand how technology affects people, and I would love to be a part of the digital transformation our society is going through.</p>
            <p>Thus, in 2018, my passion for coding was rekindled and I undertook online courses in C#. I soon realised that I wanted to change my career from nursing to a web developer, hence I began studying HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. </p>
            <p>I found that studying on my own was quite isolating and my progress was not as rapid as I wanted it to be. This is when I learned about Founders and Coders. I joined their meetup and found a very welcoming and supportive community which quickly made me want to become a part of it. I truly hope I am given the opportunity to join Founders and Coders this summer and fulfil my dream of becoming a full-stack web developer.</p></div>
